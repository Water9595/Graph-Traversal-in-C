# DFS-BFS-Graph-Traversal
This project implements a graph data structure using adjacency lists in C, and provides functionalities to perform Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) on both directed and undirected graphs.

Users can input the number of vertices, define edges between vertices, and choose the type of graph (directed or undirected). The program will then print the graph structure and perform DFS and BFS starting from the first vertex.

Key Features:
1. Graph creation using adjacency lists
2. Adding edges to both directed and undirected graphs
3. Graph traversal using DFS and BFS
4. User-friendly input for graph configuration

This project is ideal for learning basic graph algorithms and how to implement them efficiently in C.
